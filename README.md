# Slack-Push-Notify
Slack app that notifies about git pushes.

## Design Notes

Using the [Slack Apps docs](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps).

Created the app called `Push-Notify` on my workspace. For now, this will just be private to my workspace. 

Features: 

- Uses as incoming webhook

Future: 

- Richly format the message
- Supports slash commands
- Add OAuth support

### Incoming Webhooks

The app will look for a post-commit git webhook in the related repo, which is this one, for now. Webhooks are regular HTTP requests with a JSON payload. 

Flipped the right switches in the Slack API. These are great docs so far...

Added a webhook to my workspace and tried the example: 

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Hello, World!"}' <hook url here>
```

### Adding Git Hook to Repository

Referring to [Git documentation](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/githooks.txt#L295)

The server-side post-push hook is called `post-receive`:

```
This hook is invoked by linkgit:git-receive-pack[1] when it reacts to `git push` and updates reference(s) in its repository. It executes on the remote repository once after all the refs have been updated.
```

Reviewed the [git/contrib/hooks/multimail](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/hooks/multimail) post-receive hook example.

Just use Bash for this for now to make that curl call.

We're exposing that webhook URL so there's a potential for abuse, but this is a demo for today and I'll disable the webhook in a few hours.

Here's the new `post-receive` webhook, chmodded to 755:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo Notifying Slack through Push-Notify app.

curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Push-Notify repo has been updated."}' <hook url here>
```

Now to test the hook...
